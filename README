			  Unsit, version 1.5

These are the souces for "unsit", a Unix program for breaking apart
StuffIt archive files created on a Macintosh into separate files on
the Unix system.  See the documentation at the beginning of "unsit.c"
or the man page "unsit.1" for more information.

To build the program, compile unsit.c and updcrc.c and link together.
If your system doesn't have the getopt() routine in its standard
library, also compile getopt.c and include it in the link.

This program opens a pipe to the "compress" program for doing the
uncompression of some of the files in the archive.  Most Unix sites
probably already have "compress".  If not, it can be found in the
comp.sources.unix archives.
